## **Final Project Overview**

This project contains 5 folders labeled R script files, figures and tables, data, Executive Summary and Final Report. In the folder labeled R script files, there are 5 such files. The first reads in all five of the data sets that I use for this project. In the second, I cleaned each data set and created .rds files of the cleaned versions to use going forward. In the data joining R script, I joined all 5 of the .rds files into one data frame entitled pats_weather_data which I then saved as its own .rds file in order to create plots in a much more efficient manner. Then, in the univariate and multivariate analysis R scripts is all of the code for the plots and tables I created to analyze the variables of this new pats_weather_data set.

In the second folder labeled 2_figures and tables, are stored all of the figures and plots from this analysis as .png files.

In the data folder are the code books and .rds files for all 5 data sets as well as a raw folder which contains the raw form of the data which I got from external sources.

In the Executive Summary and Final Report folders are the .qmd and .html files of the Summary and Report respectively.
