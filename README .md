## Basic repo setup for final project

My final project will be analyzing statistical trends of the New England Patriots over time. My main question
is, does weather affect the outcome of football games in New England? It gets very cold in New England during the winter, and the prevailing theory that is told on TV anytime it's snowing during a game at Foxboro, is that the cold helps New England win. People believe that because they are more used to the cold, it gives them an edge against teams from, say Florida. I will be using weather data collected in Foxboro, Massachusetts as well as data about the NFL and Patriots games to look for any correlation between changes in weather and increased success
