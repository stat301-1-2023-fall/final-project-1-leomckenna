## **Raw Data**

This folder contains the raw forms of the data that I found on the internet. I collected data from the FiveThirtyEight Github about ELO ratings from all NFL games dating back to 1920[^readme--1] as well as another of their NFL data sets which includes other variables I used such as the stadium and location of every game.[^readme--2]
The other three data sets are .csvs which I converted from .pdf files I downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Data on the National Weather Service's website. The data shows monthly temperatures, precipitation levels, and snowfall levels from the Foxboro weather tower starting in the year 2000.[^readme--3]

The data sets are named follows: 

- `foxboro_temp_data.csv`
- `nfl_elo.csv`
- `nfl_games.csv`
- `rain_data.csv`
- `snowfall_foxboro.csv`
