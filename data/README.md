## Datasets

There are currently two data sets in use. The first is nfl_elo.csv which is taken from the 
data sets in the GIthub of FiveThirtyEight. It has data ranging over 100 years about the elo ratings
of each football team in each NFL matchup that has occurred in that span. The other data set is
foxboro_weather_data.csv which came from a .pdf file I downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Data on the National Weather Service's website. The data shows monthly temperatures from the Foxboro weather tower starting in the year 2000.
